# TrashCash

Trash Cash is an app to create a sense of responsibility among the users about how we dispose our waste.The recent pandemic taught us that humans are the sole reason for the climate change as in the initial stage of lockdown we saw how the sky became clearer and how the water bodies flourished without human interference.

## Motivation

The deteroiting climate conditions as well as the recent pandemic has inspired the building of the app. The COVID-19 conditions compelled us to stay cleaner and to make it an example we should be able to recyle the waste, any waste.

## How the App Works

The user can choose any of their desired category from the '+' page and then will be prompted to provide more deatils regarding the product they want to sell. After filling out the deatils of the product additional details about their address will be asked. Then the user will click the confirm button and order will be placed.

The details of the product will be stored in the history tab on the profile page of the user.
The admin will get the deatils in their portal. A database will be prepared and the information will be sent to the recycling plants for further use.

For every recyling item the user sells he/she will be given ratings and coins.According to the ratings a leaderboard will be prepared daily and the user can also redeem their points in the coupon page.

The idea of the app is to create a sense of competitiveness among the users on the basis of how much they recycle.
